      Leadership Roles
    </h1>
    <div class="par">
      <h3 style="text-align:center;">
        President/Chair
      </h3>
      <p>
        The President of the organization should see that all roles are being
        fulfilled correctly. If a board member cannot follow through with their
        tasks and other board members are not able to complete them, they come
        to the top priority of the President so that she/he may complete
        whatever is needed to the best of her/his ability. As President of
        Girls++, this leader must also complete all paperwork concerning the
        organization. This is administered, usually, by the university and can
        be completed with the help of our advisors. You are to work closely with
        all other board members, meet with them on a consistent basis and
        delegate major tasks.
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center;">
        Vice President/Vice Chair
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Vice President (VP) of the organization shall take on any task that
        the President cannot complete (this includes helping other board members
        complete their tasks if he/she is not available to do so). In the
        absence of the President of the organization, the VP must take on the
        role of delegation of tasks to ensure everything follows through. The VP
        should also be of “advisement” to the President whereas they may discuss
        ideas and future projects for the organization before presenting it to
        everyone else.
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center;">
        Secretary
      </h3>
      <p>
        The secretary of the organization plays a big role specifically at
        e-board meetings and General Body Meetings. Thus, as the Secretary of
        the organization, you must clearly state if you are available for the
        next event (or not) and for what times.
      </p>
      <p>
        -At E-Board Meetings: Make sure you bring a laptop as you will be
        responsible for taking “Meeting Minutes” (notes) on all of the major
        topics discussed. After the meeting, make sure these notes are uploaded
        to the appropriate folder in our Google Drive and email the link to this
        document out to all board members, including advisors.
      </p>
      <p>
        -At GBMs: You are in charge of bringing any printouts we may need. This
        includes but is not limited to any QR codes we may want printed, sign-in
        sheets, and informational handouts. It is your responsibility to find
        out what print outs we need prior to an event. You can use the Mailing
        Room in the CS department for free printing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other main tasks as secretary that should not be too tedious include:
        Maintaining Google Drive folder Checking Girls++ Email and keeping
        everyone up to date on what we may receive!
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center;">
        Program Chair
      </h3>
      <p>
        As Program Chair of Girls++ you have a major networking opportunity! You
        are responsible for programming our events, which mostly means being in
        contact with our guest speakers. This includes finding guest speakers
        (if needed), emailing them essential information such as time and date,
        location, parking details and so on (you can find helpful scripts for
        this in our Google Drive folder under “Event Planning”), and even
        meeting them at their parking deck and walking them over to our event
        space if necessary. Thus, it is essential that you clearly state if you
        will be available for GBMs or not, this way another team member will be
        prepared to fill this role for you if you cannot be present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, another essential part of event planning includes creating the
        PowerPoint presentation for events. You can refer to either of the “GBM”
        folders under “Spring 2019” in our Google Drive to see some examples of
        how we carry our meetings. Usually the set-up goes something like this:
      </p>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Welcome Screen</li>
        <li>Introduction of present officers</li>
        <li>Announcements</li>
        <li>Introduction of guest speakers</li>
        <li>Insert speaker(s) slides here</li>
        <li>Thank you screen and our social media info</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The presentation should be ready at least 24hours before an event so
        that each team member can familiarize themselves with it. Note, not
        every GBM will require a PowerPoint presentation. This is completely a
        group decision and will be based on what kind of event the organization
        is putting on!
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center;">
        Membership Chair
      </h3>
      <p>
        As Membership Chair of Girls++, you will take on most roles having to do
        with an any members (within and outside of the e-board). You are to
        decide how our audience will be accounted for at GBMs (sign-in sheet,
        google form, QR code, etc.) and produce those documents. If anything
        shall need to be printed out, then you are to send it to the Secretary
        in a timely matter so that they may bring it to the meeting. If he/she
        cannot make it, the responsibility falls on you to print and present the
        sheets. In any other case, make it known to the e-board and any
        available member may comply.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is of interest to all e-board members to market our events, but as
        membership chair, you have the bigger part in this! You can spread the
        word of Girls++ and our events in many ways: word of mouth, passing out
        or posting physical flyers (you can use the SGA office to print multiple
        flyers or any Girls++ related paperwork), ensuring our event flyers are
        shot out to the CS department via email (send the flyer to Jamie Hayes
        and he will get this done for you!), and you may also help the Outreach
        chair create our flyers and social media content.
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center;">
        Outreach Chair
      </h3>
      <p>
        As the Outreach Chair of Girls++, your major task is to get the word out
        about us! When we have an event coming up, no matter how big or how
        small, create a flyer to let people know what we’re doing. It is up to
        you whether this flyer shall be printed and posted around campus or if
        it should just go on our Social Media accounts or newsletter (or all of
        the above)! As our Social Media manager, you are to make a schedule of
        when and what you are going to post about every week. We want to keep
        our followers engaged and make sure we don’t abandon them, so shoot for
        a minimum of 3-4 posts a week and a max of 3 posts per day. For example,
        after an event you may want to post a bunch of the pictures we’ve taken!
        Point is, we want to maintain regular posting so that we remain
        interesting on Social Media. Also, it is your goal to make our account
        interactive (i.e. use the poll and question features on stories, respond
        to DMs).
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center;">
        Treasurer
      </h3>
      <p>
        As the Treasurer of the organization, your biggest task will be to
        delegate our budget (I think this is our first semester with one). It
        may be a little fuzzy at first but as we roll on through the semester
        you will get a better idea of how much we need for certain commodities
        (i.e. food, décor, speaker parking, etc.). Shall we not have any money
        remaining, and any E-board member may have to spend out-of-pocket to
        make an event happen. Thus, you will be in charge of handling
        reimbursements for any member that may need one. You can find a link to
        the necessary Reimbursement form in our Google Drive under the “Event
        Planning” folder > “Reimbursement Steps”. This form must be completed
        (only in the areas indicated), printed and turned in within 30 days of
        the day of purchase. So be sure to contact anyone you think may need a
        reimbursement in a timely matter. The “Reimbursement Steps” form has
        everything you need to know when completing a form.
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center;">
        Webmaster
      </h3>
      <p>
        As the Webmaster of the organization, you are awesome. Your main task is
        to maintain our website or create a new one if you don’t agree with the
        style of what we currently have. Our website is currently hosted from
        GitHub Pages and the entire repo can be accessed through our Girls++
        GitHub account (log in credentials can be found in our Google Drive
        under “Social media Info”). It is important that you stay in contact
        with the e-board so that you know what is going on with the organization
        and what information you should update the website with (i.e. event
        dates, recent event pictures, etc.). Provide the link to the website to
        our Outreach and Membership Chairs so that they may add it to our social
        media accounts, event flyers and newsletter, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, you will be in charge of the management of the Girls++
        weekly newsletter. We are currently handling this from MailChimp and the
        credentials to access our MailChimp account can be found in our Google
        Drive “Social Media Info” folder as well. It is your responsibility to
        design the newsletter, research tech-related events to include, and
        report the statistics from it at or before every e-board meeting. The
        newsletter must also include our upcoming events for which we have set
        dates, so make sure you keep in tune with what the organization is up
        to. It is ideal for the newsletter to be sent out once a week every
        Sunday and for there to be different content each week (unless they are
        our upcoming events you’re continuing to announce of course).
